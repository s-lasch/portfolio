## **TLDR**
> In this post, I will cover concepts in **reinforcement learning (RL)**, specifically Q-Learning, applied to the context of maximizing returns in a simulated stock market environment.

Enjoy! 🙂

## **Q-Learning**
As briefly described above, Q-Learning is an RL technique that learns the optimal strategy (called a **policy** in RL) from three distinct elements: the **action space**, the **state space**, and a **reward function**. Interestingly, the "Q" in Q-Learning comes from the act of focusing on the *quality* of each action, and choosing the best action.

### **Actions**
The action space refers to the total (cardinality) of all possible actions a learner can take.[^1] In the context of a simulated market, we have 3 possible states: buy, sell, and exit market (going from a long/short position to holding 0 shares). When given some data, the Q-Learner will output one of these actions, \\( \\{{0, 1, 2}\\} =\\) buy, sell, hold.

### **States** 
The state space likewise refers to all possible states of the learning environment at any given point in time. Determining the cardinality of the state space is tricky, as this number largely depends on our input features. Say, for example, we have 5 input features. 

These input features must go through some function, \\(f(x)\\), that turns the continuous data into a singular integer representing unique values for all of our features. The process of converting raw continuous data into a singular integer, regardless of the number of input features, is called **discretization**.

The function \\(f(x)\\) should also slice the input vector into a number of bins. Each bin is then mapped to an integer. When a vector comes into the discretization function. In the image above, feature \\(X_1\\) is put into bin 9, \\(X_2\\) into bin 4, and \\(X_n\\) into bin 2. These integers are then spliced together to create one integer. 

### **Reward Function**
Perhaps the most important pillar of a Q-Learner is the reward function. Of all the pillars, this should be most intuitive, especially for animal trainers. In this context, how do we reward our pets for making favorable decisions when training them to sit, or better yet, do a trick? Do we give them treats immediately after each success, or only once at the very end if they do everything right? 

This decision will impact the time it will take for the learner to learn. Lots of questions need to be answered, mainly how do we reward our learner for making good trades, or penalize the learner for making subpar trades? What factors should be considered when making this decision? Do we base it on daily returns, or cumulative return for a prospective trade?

Q-Learners will converge to the optimal policy much faster when **immediate reward** is used.  [^2] In the context of pet training, immediately rewarding the animal after each success will help the animal to associate each action with positive reinforcement.

## **Conclusion**
In this post, we've gone through an introduction to Q-Learning—the three pillars, what they mean, and how we can apply this in a simulated market. We also covered discretization, or the process of representing continuous data as discrete integers, and the importance of this in determining states.
